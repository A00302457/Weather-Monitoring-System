# Weather-Monitoring-System
A weather monitoring system where weather data is collected and multiple displays are updated when the weather changes.

I have almost finished my assignment but I am not sure if I did it correctly. To complete the assignment, I referred to my professor's class videos multiple times and used the work I did in class as a reference. Additionally, I searched on Google to better understand all the design patterns and also went through the MS learning modules. However, if I am still incorrect, it would be unfortunate for me.
